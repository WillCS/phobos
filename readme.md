# Phobos Lua Interpreter

## Disclaimer
This is the first time I've ever written anything in Rust. There will be very bad code.

**You have been warned**.

## Components
- Tokeniser
  - Regex based
  - Outputs token sequence
- Parser
  - Bottom up parsing automaton
  - I'd like to investigate having a lot of this be generated by macros at compile time but
    that seems super complicated
- Type Checker
- Abstract Syntax Tree Optimisation stage (maybe?)
- Execution Engine w/ Garbage collector
